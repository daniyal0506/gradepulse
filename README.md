# gradepulse

A website made to  show the UIC grade distributions in a more readable format. The current format is very tedious to search through and isn't efficient at all. The goal of this website is to make it a lot easier to look at grade distributions for courses, by being able to look at graphs and other instructor data. Hope this helps!
